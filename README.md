# Evaluating Alarm Classifiers with High-Confidence Data Programming

This repository contains data and scripts from the case study of clinical alarms in Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Each folder represents classification rates and their bounds one of the clinical datasets.

The scripts for visualizing and calculating the coverage of true rate curves are written in Wolfram/Mathematica. To run them, see the instructions below. 

## Using Wolfram/Mathematica Implementations

### Executing with Wolfram Player

Requirements: [Wolfram Player](https://www.wolfram.com/player/) version 12.2+. 

To execute the notebooks in this software package, you need to dowload and install a free version of the Wolfram Player: 

1) Download and install the [Wolfram Player](https://www.wolfram.com/player/) for your OS. 
2) Create a Wolfram ID account (if you do not have one). 
3) Accept the terms of the [free license](https://www.wolfram.com/engine/free-license)
4) Start the Wolfram Player
5) Input your Wolfram ID and password into the prompt
6) Open the desired .nb file and either run it al  at once (Ctrl+A, Shift+Enter) or block-by-block (select a line, Shift+Enter).

The notebooks implement various exploratory experiments, visualizations, and cached bundlings.

### Editing with Mathematica notebook 

Requirements: To edit the scripts, you would require [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), version 12.1+. You can obtain a [free 30-day trial](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/trial/) or you find yourself be at an instutition with an [academic license](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/pricing/colleges-universities/).
